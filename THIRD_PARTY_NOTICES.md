# Third-party notices

The MIT license in `LICENSE` covers this repository, except:

- everything under `invisible_engine_dots/`, a hard fork of nanobot, which
  is under `invisible_engine_dots/LICENSE` and the nested notice listed in
  its section below.

That fork, and the text this repository's history holds through the earlier
TypeScript engine, come with the notices below.

## Open Multi-Agent

The earlier TypeScript engine (`guest-runtime/engine/`) was derived in part
from it. That engine is deleted; its files and its `UPSTREAM.md` (source,
version and commit) are in this repository's history, before the commit
"repo: delete the earlier TypeScript engine and agent", and this notice stays
for as long as that history does.

## context-chef

`@context-chef/core` 4.2.1. Open Multi-Agent's `agent/runner.ts`, as imported
into this repository's history, contained `groupIntoTurns` and
`stripMediaBlocksForSummary`, modelled on this library (the deleted engine's
`UPSTREAM.md` records the details).

## nanobot

`invisible_engine_dots/` is imported from nanobot
(https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot, commit
`f75470e72f0993dcf92accc81282adaa48b16f56`) and modified for invisible_dots.
It is a hard fork: upstream changes are not tracked or merged. Source, commit,
what the import left out and what was removed since:
`invisible_engine_dots/UPSTREAM.md`. Its
`LICENSE`, byte for byte:

The fork carries one further notice, which stays next to the code it covers:

- `invisible_engine_dots/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`: says that no third-party
  component is vendored in the fork.

Its Python dependencies are not part of this repository: the golden image's
build installs them from PyPI as the wheels their publishers released, pinned
by hash in `guest/image-builder/builder/engine-requirements.lock`, each under
its own license. The runtime disk carries the fork's own source with its
`LICENSE` and `UPSTREAM.md` (`/opt/invisible-dots/engine/` in the guest).

## The opt-in WhatsApp client and `libsignal` (GPL-3.0)

The WhatsApp adapter (`packages/channels/src/whatsapp-baileys/`) loads Baileys
(MIT) from `node_modules` when a person links WhatsApp. Baileys depends on the
npm package `libsignal`, which is under the GNU General Public License,
version 3, and so does not fit this repository's MIT license. None of it is
part of this repository: it is installed by `npm ci` like any dependency, the
command bundle that `apps/cli/scripts/build.mjs` makes leaves Baileys (and with
it `libsignal`) out, and nothing loads it unless the server was started with
`INVISIBLE_DOTS_WHATSAPP=1` and a person links a number. Whoever distributes a
build of this repository together with its `node_modules`, or wants a GPL-free
install, has to take that into account: the way out is to leave the adapter
and its dependency out (`packages/channels/package.json`).
