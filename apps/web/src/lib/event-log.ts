/**
 * Reading a Dot's event log through the one route that serves it, `GET /api/dots/:id/events`, which keeps the types
 * (and the task) a caller names in the database so only those cross the wire. No view reads the whole log of a Dot:
 * that costs more with every day it lives. A view reads what it shows, bounded on one side: the events of one task
 * (`taskId`), the events from a point on (`readEventLog` with `after`), the range between two points
 * (`readEventRange`), or the newest window (`readRecentEvents`, which the Activity page goes on from, older, a page
 * at a time, with a `before`). Each says which types it reads and, where a type alone is not enough, what else an
 * event must be.
