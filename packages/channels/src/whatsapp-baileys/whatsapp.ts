/**
 * WhatsApp as a channel of the hub, over the port of `port.ts`. This is where WhatsApp's own decisions are
 * made; every policy that is the same on all channels (who may talk, rate limits, retries, where an answer
 * goes) is still the hub's.
 *
 * - Opt-in and unofficial. The default connection is Baileys, which acts as a linked device of a personal
 *   WhatsApp account; WhatsApp does not allow automation on those and can ban the account. Use a number of its
 *   own (a spare SIM or eSIM), never the one a person lives on.
 * - Reply-only. Nothing is sent to a chat that did not write first: the hub sends only to paired people, who
 *   pair by writing the code. Strangers are never answered, not even told they are refused, and a read receipt
 *   goes only to a chat the Dot is about to answer, so no stranger learns that the number is alive. Every send
 *   is preceded by a short human-sized pause with a typing indicator. No groups, no broadcast, no attachments.
 * - Identity. A person is the phone number when it is known (from the address, its twin, or what the account
 *   learned before) and the LID otherwise, so the same person is the same peer whichever address WhatsApp uses.
 *   The one edge: a person paired while only their LID was known, whose number is learned later, appears under
 *   the number and has to pair again.
 * - No buttons. A prompt tells the person to answer `yes ap-xxxxxx` or `no ap-xxxxxx`; the hub reads the reply.
 * - WhatsApp confirms a message to its sender when it arrives, not when the hub dealt with it, so a message the
 *   hub could not record is lost: the connection is dropped, the channel shows `error`, and the person writes again.
