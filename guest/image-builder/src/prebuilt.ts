/**
 * The golden image built once by CI and downloaded, instead of an hour of
 * provisioning on every host (architecture section 3.3). A release of the
 * repository named `golden-<inputs digest>` holds it: the digest is the one
 * `buildGoldenImage` computes from the pinned inputs of this checkout, so a
 * host only ever takes the image of exactly its own inputs, and builds it
 * itself when no such release exists (a changed pin, a fork, no network).
 *
 * The release holds `release.json` (this file's `PrebuiltRelease`), the
 * image's manifest, and the image in parts, because a release asset is at
 * most 2 GiB. Each part is checked against its SHA-256 as it is downloaded,
 * and the whole image against the manifest's SHA-256 and size once it is put
 * together, before it is written under its final name.
