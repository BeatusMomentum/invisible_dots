/**
 * What an approval prompt says in a chat, and what it says once the approval is settled. One owner of the
 * wording, so every channel shows the same thing. Plain text: a channel adds its own means of answering.
 *
 * The prompt goes through a third party that can read it (a chat is not end-to-end encrypted), so the arguments of the
 * tool, which can hold private data, are cut to `ARGUMENTS_MAX` characters. A secret that has no place in an approval
 * (a proxy password, the user and the query values of a URL) is replaced by the engine in the event itself (architecture
 * section 6): this module shows the arguments as the event has them and redacts nothing.
