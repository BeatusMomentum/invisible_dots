/**
 * `invisible-dots setup --all`: everything the quick start did by hand after `npm ci`, in order, as one command that
 * can be run again. Each step is the code of the command that owns it (the guest daemon and web client builds in
 * build.ts, QEMU and its accelerator in setup.ts, `image build` in host.ts) and skips what is already done, so a run
 * that stopped, for a restart, a new login or a failure, is continued by running the same command again.
 *
 * The one step that needs administrator rights stays one step: it is `setup`'s, which asks once. It comes second,
 * after the quick daemon build that finds a missing Go before anything is changed, and before the long builds, so a
 * restart it asks for costs nothing already done.
