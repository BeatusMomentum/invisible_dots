/**
 * Delivery of host to guest events (sections 5.4 and 9.5) from the durable
 * outbox in `inbound_events`. Whatever the control plane decides to tell a
 * guest (a claimed task, a message, an approval, a cancel) is stored first,
 * in the transaction that decided it; this class only sends what is stored.
 *
 * Per Dot, one flush runs at a time and sends the pending rows in order,
 * stopping at the first failure so a later event never overtakes an earlier
 * one. A Dot that is not READY is woken first. A row is marked delivered
 * only on the guest's 202; the guest keeps every event id it accepted, so a
 * row whose send had an unknown outcome (a timeout, a reset connection) is
 * simply sent again. Every READY transition flushes the Dot again, so
 * nothing waits for a timer once the guest is back.
