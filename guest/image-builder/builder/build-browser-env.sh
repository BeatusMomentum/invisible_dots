# Builds the Dot's browser (architecture sections 3.3 and 6), as user dot: the Python
# environment of invisible-playwright-mcp from the hashed lock, the command on dot's PATH,
# the browser engine the wrapper's seal expects, and the GeoIP database that a launch with
# the timezone left to "auto" needs. provision.sh runs it as root inside the golden image's
# builder VM, and the browser smoke runs it on a plain ubuntu:24.04 container, so both build
# the same thing. The Dot's browser is this server and nothing else (owner's rule).
#
#   build-browser-env.sh <lock> <environment directory>
#
# The command is linked into ~dot/.local/bin, which the units put on the PATH of dot-agentd and
# of the engine.
#
# The lock is a hashed list of every package at an exact version (uv pip install
# --require-hashes), so a file that changed on the index, or a dependency missing from the
# lock, fails the build instead of entering the image. The engine is fetched with the
# invisible-playwright of that environment, so the cached engine is the one the server's seal
# expects; it and the GeoIP file land in ~dot/.cache/invisible-playwright. The GeoIP file is
# the latest build of daijro/geoip-all-in-one on the day of the build: a launch checks for a
# newer one and keeps this one when it cannot reach GitHub.
