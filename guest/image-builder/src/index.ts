/**
 * `invisible-dots image build` (architecture sections 3.3 and 11): the golden
 * image and the runtime ISO, built on the host from public sources.
 *
 * The caller supplies the host: the QEMU programs from the vm-manager's
 * discovery, its `accelerator()`, and a process runner that can also spawn
 * the long-running builder VM (the CLI adapts its own process.ts to it).
 * The QEMU path rules and the image file names come from the vm-manager and
 * shared, as for the Dots. Nothing here decides anything per operating
 * system.
